                    <h3>Computational Methods for Quantitative Finance</h3>
                    <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
					<p>Our mission is to inspire and motivate financial analysts and general practitioners not only to use well-known and acknowledged specialized software but also to propose alternative financial engineering solutions (FES).</p>
					<h4>Objectives</h4>
					<p>Following our mission statement we come together to develop all subsequent initiatives, but not less of importance are the following:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>proposing vanguard solutions to complex problems</li>
						<li>writing solutions in various programming languages</li>
						<li>aggregating a library of ready-to-use, freely available solutions</li>
						<li>extending the variety of our open access library</li>
						<li>completing the FES library and categorize into separate sections according to the preferred programming language, e.g. MATLAB, MapleSoft, C, C+, C++, .NET etc.</li>
						<li>classifying of 'computational methods for Quantitative Finance' according to their efficiency taking into account criteria and factors such as universality, hardness in computer implementation and application, compatibility, understandability, computational speed, high accuracy and etc.</li>
						<li>gathering international scientists and people whose research activity is interdisciplinary</li>
						<li>building a social network of professionals and increasing the possibility for them to discuss new ideas and collaborate periodically during events, traditional conferences and one annual general meetings (AGM)</li>
						<li>imposing the requirements FES should comply with, such as generic implementation, stability, effectiveness and degree of correctness</li>
						<li>understanding the limitations of widely used products and making explicit decisions when a custom solution is necessary and has to be developed</li>
						</ul>
